Distributed one stop social and cloud solution for everyday users

This would be an application that would reside on a laptop or desktop of an everyday user.

The application will use peer to peer network to establish DNS between instances. User's client will update the IP address to that DNS periodically.

When a user adds a friend, they'll exchange tokens/keys (like gnupg keys) and that will encrypt decrypt messages between them. Also will authenticate that the user is a trusted one.

For social exchange, we can use protocol from matrix.org.

Users content will reside on his/her computer. So the data will always belong to the user.
